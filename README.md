# IndieHabits

A minimalist habit-tracking iOS app built with SwiftUI.

## Overview

This app allows tracking habits and streaks in a minimalist, clean interface. Key features:

- Add, edit, and delete habits
- Track habit streaks and completion day-by-day  
- Set reminders to complete habits
- Persist data locally using UserDefaults

The goal was to build a habit tracker tailored exactly to my needs, while learning iOS development with SwiftUI along the way.

## Screens 

The app has two main tabs:

**Current Habits** - View and track ongoing habits

**Completed Habits** - View past habits that have been completed

---

**Habit Details** - View monthly calendar grid and tap to mark a day as complete.

**Add Habit** - Add a new habit

**Edit Habit** - Edit an existing habit

## Building

This project was built using:

- Xcode 14
- SwiftUI

No external dependencies are needed.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `HabitTracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the app on the iOS simulator
